# Collatz_in_Java
A little java program that shows collatz ranges

This exercise was done early in my programming education.
I was learning some basic Java programming and this was the first exercise in which I created a UI with Swing.

The program letâ€™s you input numbers and then outputs the Collatz result. 
It checks for correct input and it checks for Collatz ranges.
